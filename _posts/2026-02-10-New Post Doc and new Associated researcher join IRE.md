Associated Professor Islam S. M. Khalil will be Work Package leader for the team that works with creating robotic endoscopes.

Islam received his master's and doctoral degrees in Mechatronics Engineering. He is currently an Associate Professor in the RAM—Robotics and Mechatronics research group at the University of Twente. He is also affiliated with the Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine of Radboud University Medical Center. For two years, he was a post-doctoral fellow in the Robotics and Mechatronics research group and TechMed Centre–Institute for Biomedical Technology and Technical Medicine, University of Twente. His research interests include the modelling and design of motion control systems for soft microrobots, biologically inspired microrobots, mechatronic system design, and untethered magnetic micro/nanorobotics with applications in micro/nanomanipulation, and targeted drug delivery.


Postdoc Mostafa Selim will be working on the teleoperation and interface systems for colonoscopy as part of this project. His PhD focused on haptic feedback techniques for needle insertion procedures, and his research interests include robotics, dynamics, and control.

Mostafa is excited for the opportunity to collaborate on developing innovative solutions that enhance comfort and usability, ultimately improving the experience for both patients and surgeons during colon inspection and treatment.
