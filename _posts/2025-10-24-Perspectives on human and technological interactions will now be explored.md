Drawing from classic ethnographic methods we will explore patient and provider perspectives on new technologies for colonoscopy. We will engage with ideas in Science and Technology Studies when exploring the ways that researchers from very different disciplines work together to develop these new technologies.

The aims are to explore how an actual Intelligent Robotic endoscope might be improved from insights into medical practitioners and patients' experience with the technology, and to see if cooperation can be improved to gain better results.


It will be fun, exciting and not as simple as it might sound!
