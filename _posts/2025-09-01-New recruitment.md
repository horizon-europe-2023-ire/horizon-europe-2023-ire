Guanglin will be a part of the IRE project. 
His research will focus on reinforcement learning-based navigation and control of soft robotic colonoscopy in the developed deformable simulator. 

Guanglin completed his PhD in computer science and information engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China, in 2025. His PhD primarily focused on developing data-driven modeling, control, and motion planning strategies for soft continuum robots. 

His interests include medical robotics, control, and reinforcement learning.

Beyond research, Guanglin is passionate about basketball and table tennis. He also loves walking along the seashore to clear his mind.
