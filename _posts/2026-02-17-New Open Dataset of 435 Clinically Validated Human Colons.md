The IRE4Health consortium is pleased to share that a new publication by our researchers and collaborators has just been released in Nature Scientific Data:

**“Clinically validated dataset of 435 human colons segmented from CT colonography.”**
See the full paper here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-06518-z

This publication presents the first and largest openly available dataset of high resolution, clinically validated segmentations of human colons derived from CT colonography scans. The dataset includes 435 anatomically detailed colon models, providing a unique resource for the research community. 

**Why this dataset is important**
This large-scale, high quality dataset enables important advances in several areas, including:

• Population scale radiologic research, supporting studies based on robust anatomical data

• Development of AI based image analysis tools, especially for colon segmentation and pathology detection

• Creation of anatomically accurate digital models and simulators, both virtual and physical

• Improving training opportunities, including applications in medical education and procedural simulation

**The work was carried out by:**
Martina Finocchiaro, Ronja Stern, Rikke Vilhelmsborg, Abraham George Smith, Jens Petersen, Kristoffer Cold, Lars Konge, Kenny Erleben & Melanie Ganz Benjaminsen.

This achievement marks an important milestone for the community and strengthens the foundation for future innovation in radiology, computational modeling, and medical simulation.
