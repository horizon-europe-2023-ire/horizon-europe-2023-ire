**New Postdoc Joins IRE**

Martina Finocchiaro has recently started her position as a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen, as part of the IRE project. Her research will focus on developing advanced colonoscopy simulators for designing innovative endoscopes, training endoscopists, and creating new strategies for operator assistance.

Martina completed her Marie Skłodowska-Curie Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Spain, and in Biorobotics at Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna, Italy, in 2023. Her Ph.D. research primarily focused on developing a framework for evaluating human-machine interfaces in robot-assisted intraluminal procedures. She holds a M.Sc. in Bionics Engineering and a B.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering. Her interests include medical robotics and simulation, ingestible and intraluminal robots, and human-machine interfaces.

Beyond research, Martina is passionate about sports, with interests ranging from skiing and surfing to dancing, muay thai, and aerial hoop. 

Welcome, Martina!
