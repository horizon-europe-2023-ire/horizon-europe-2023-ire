#### About the workshop
Digital twins and medical robots are two rapidly advancing technologies reshaping the future of medicine and healthcare. With the integration of real-time data and advanced AI, medical robots are evolving from precision tools to adaptive, intelligent agents capable of personalizing care like never before.

Digital twins — dynamic, virtual representations of organs, systems, or entire patients — enable robotics systems to simulate, predict, and personalize medical interventions. This synergy not only enhances the accuracy of medical interventions, but it also opens new pathways for training and validating AI and robotic systems reducing animal testing. These virtual models can be used to run in-silico trials, simulate rare conditions, and stress-test robotic behaviors in ways that are ethical, scalable, and replicable.

By bringing together researchers, developers and healthcare professionals, the workshop will:

- Showcase how AI, robotics, and digital twins combine to drive medical innovation.
- Highlight data challenges, including model reliability, real-time sensing, and validation.
- Discuss how these technologies can replace or reduce in-vitro and in-vivo testing.
- Engage with ethical, legal, and societal implications, especially around patient data, model transparency, biases and safety.
 

This workshop aligns with Denmark’s strong commitments to healthcare innovation, digital health, and responsible AI. It will feature expert talks, practical case studies, and collaborative discussions, offering inspiration and insight across disciplines.
