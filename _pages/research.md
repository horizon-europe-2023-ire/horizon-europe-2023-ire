# Introduction

Interventional endoscopy maximizes the benefits of minimally invasive clinical procedures, as it allows clinicians to
reach the internal human anatomy while leveraging minimal incisions using the body’s natural pathways. This translates
into minimum impact on patients, avoiding complex open-surgery interventions, reducing risk, and minimizing
recovery time. Nevertheless, endoscopic procedures are not without challenges. 

Endoscopes are long flexible devices, with many degrees of freedom, difficult to operate and control. Like other soft mechanisms, they are also undersensed,
and clinicians typically need to guess the location and orientation of an endoscope with minimal available
information. This problem is exacerbated in endoscopic procedures, such as colonoscopy, where the only information
is the inserted length of the endoscope and a local view of the body’s narrow passage through a camera mounted on
the tip of the endoscope. Navigation through the body anatomy and mapping of the covered anatomy become complex
tasks to be carried out by the clinician, without much technological support. In the case of colonoscopy, the
challenges in endoscope navigation can lead to severe injuries such as colon perforation due to excessive forces, or
misdiagnosis such as undetected cancerous tissue due to looping of the endoscope.

Endoscopy poses a tremendous opportunity for autonomous robotics and human-robot interaction in complex changing
environments. The combined endoscope-body system highlights many classical challenges in robotics, including
mechanism design, system identification, mechanical simulation, and manipulation control. Furthermore, it opens
challenges for modern areas of robotics related to digital emerging technologies, and new enabling material and
sensor technology. This includes soft robot design, model-based sensing, learning-based navigation, sensory augmentation,
human-robot cooperation, or robot-based training. 

The irruption of intelligent robotic endoscopy can drastically advance the possibilities for in-vivo endoscope navigation, endoscope design, and clinical operator training.
Altogether, given the ageing European population and the massive European effort on beating cancer (BECA), intelligent
robotic endoscopy manifests as a key approach to safety and effectiveness under the expected increase in
endoscopic procedures.

## Intelligent robotic endoscopy

The Intelligent Robotic Endoscopes (IRE) for improved healthcare services project will address multiple scientific
and technical challenges across intelligent robotic endoscopy. Due to the underactuated and under-sensed nature of
endoscopes, the project will leverage a digital value chain based on simulation models and learning-based techniques
to reconstruct missing information and guide intelligent algorithms. The development of simulation models of soft
endoscopes and soft anatomy will be rooted on modern methods of statistical modelling for anatomy/geometry, and
model-order reduction and differentiable simulation for mechanics. Furthermore, learning-based techniques will
drive the design of control policies, navigation methods, and navigation feedback based on sensory augmentation.
The proposed simulation models and learning-based control methods will be applied to solve problems of endoscope
design, intelligent navigation assistance, virtual-reality-based training, and soft robot phantom-based testing/training.

Novel methods will be tested on phantoms, as a validation step toward clinical deployment. Intelligent endoscopes
are not meant to replace the human operator but will empower the operator with enriched information to make informed
decisions. The project results will be demonstrated on colonoscopy, as a particularly impactful case of endoscopy.


# Objectives

The IRE project aims to empower endoscopy technology by inventing next-step autonomy robotic functionalities
that create a step change in undertaking non-repetitive colonoscopy cancer screening procedures in realistic laboratory
settings. This includes critical safe human-robot interactions when operating in the complex and dynamic working
environments inside of the human body. 

The results will be demonstrated on three real-world scenarios within colonoscopy: endoscope design (both through novel digital methodologies and novel technical robotic functionalities),
endoscope operator training (using both virtual-reality-based and phantom-based training), and endoscope operator
assistance (through intelligent navigation, human-robot interaction, and augmented sensory feedback). The
proposed results will be possible by advancing the state of the art on many areas of cognitive robotics and digital
supply chain technology.

The IRE project will work on five specific objectives, which can be summarised as:

**1) Soft robotic endoscopes**
Create the first AI-powered soft robotic endoscopes, with an increased level of autonomy through fine manipulation
control and sensory augmentation for operator feedback, optimised through model-based design.

**2) Robotic test and train phantoms**
Build a soft robot phantom of human anatomy for continuous development and clinical validation of intelligent
robotic endoscopes, measuring functional performance against clinical data.

**3) AI-enabled digital endoscope twins**
Provide fast and highly accurate digital twins of the robotic endoscope and the complex dynamic environment
of the soft tissue, suitable for data-driven learning and optimisation.

**4) AI-powered navigation**
Develop learning-based methods to design navigation policies for operator assistance in complex endoscopy
tasks and increase the level of autonomy to improve human-robot collaboration.

**5) OPEN/FAIR models and data.**
Develop OPEN and FAIR models and datasets that will facilitate further research on intelligent robotic endoscopes,
applied to colonoscopy.
