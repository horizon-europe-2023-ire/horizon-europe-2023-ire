Interventional endoscopy maximizes the benefits of minimally invasive clinical procedures, as it allows clinicians to
reach the internal human anatomy while leveraging minimal incisions using the body’s natural pathways. This translates
into minimum impact on patients, avoiding complex open-surgery interventions, reducing risk, and minimizing
recovery time. Nevertheless, endoscopic procedures are not without challenges. 

Endoscopes are long flexible devices, with many degrees of freedom, difficult to operate and control. Like other soft mechanisms, they are also undersensed,
and clinicians typically need to guess the location and orientation of an endoscope with minimal available
information. This problem is exacerbated in endoscopic procedures, such as colonoscopy, where the only information
is the inserted length of the endoscope and a local view of the body’s narrow passage through a camera mounted on
the tip of the endoscope. Navigation through the body anatomy and mapping of the covered anatomy become complex
tasks to be carried out by the clinician, without much technological support. In the case of colonoscopy, the
challenges in endoscope navigation can lead to severe injuries such as colon perforation due to excessive forces, or
misdiagnosis such as undetected cancerous tissue due to looping of the endoscope.


Endoscopy poses a tremendous opportunity for autonomous robotics and human-robot interaction in complex changing
environments. The combined endoscope-body system highlights many classical challenges in robotics, including
mechanism design, system identification, mechanical simulation, and manipulation control. Furthermore, it opens
challenges for modern areas of robotics related to digital emerging technologies, and new enabling material and
sensor technology. This includes soft robot design, model-based sensing, learning-based navigation, sensory augmentation,
human-robot cooperation, or robot-based training. 

The irruption of intelligent robotic endoscopy can drastically
advance the possibilities for in-vivo endoscope navigation, endoscope design, and clinical operator training.
Altogether, given the ageing European population and the massive European effort on beating cancer (BECA), intelligent
robotic endoscopy manifests as a key approach to safety and effectiveness under the expected increase in
endoscopic procedures.

**Objectives**
The IRE project aims to empower endoscopy technology by inventing next-step autonomy robotic functionalities
that create a step change in undertaking non-repetitive colonoscopy cancer screening procedures in realistic laboratory
settings. This includes critical safe human-robot interactions when operating in the complex and dynamic working
environments inside of the human body. 

The results will be demonstrated on three real-world scenarios within colonoscopy: endoscope design (both through novel digital methodologies and novel technical robotic functionalities),
endoscope operator training (using both virtual-reality-based and phantom-based training), and endoscope operator
assistance (through intelligent navigation, human-robot interaction, and augmented sensory feedback). The
proposed results will be possible by advancing the state of the art on many areas of cognitive robotics and digital
supply chain technology.
